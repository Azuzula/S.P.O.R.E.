# S.P.O.R.E.
### Shared Posts Over Remote Ecosystems

SPORE adds a social layer on top of existing websites.

No new platform.  
No new feed.  
No walled garden.

Just conversations growing where the web already lives.

---

## 🧬 What is SPORE?

SPORE is a browser extension that allows users to create and read discussions directly on any webpage.

Instead of moving people to another social network, SPORE attaches conversations to the page itself.

Think of it as:

- a hidden discussion layer
- a decentralized comment system
- an experiment in social infrastructure

---

## 🌱 Philosophy

The web became fragmented into isolated platforms.

SPORE explores a different idea:

> What if discussion could exist *everywhere*, without owning the content?

SPORE does not replace websites.  
It grows on top of them.

## ⚙️ Current State

This project is **experimental** and evolving.

What already works:

- Chrome extension (Manifest v3)
- Overlay UI
- Google OAuth login
- Threads and comments
- External storage (Google Drive)
- Backend metadata indexing

What is still evolving:

- scalability
- moderation concepts
- UX improvements
- community workflows

## 🧪 Why Open Source?

SPORE has grown beyond a solo experiment.

This repository is opened for:

- curious developers
- experimenters
- designers
- thinkers who like weird internet ideas

You don't need to write code to contribute.

Ideas, discussions, testing and criticism are welcome.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

Start small:

- report bugs
- suggest use-cases
- improve UX
- discuss architecture
- pick issues tagged `good first issue`

If you are unsure where to start, open a discussion.

## 🧭 Project Direction

SPORE is exploring questions like:

- Can social interaction exist without central platforms?
- Can discussions be attached to context instead of apps?
- Can users own their data while sharing publicly?

There are no final answers yet.

---

## 🧠 Who is behind this?

SPORE started as a solo project by a curious builder exploring new ways people could communicate online.

Now it is an open experiment.

---

## ⚠️ Early Warning

This project is experimental.

Things may break.  
Ideas may change.  
That's part of the process.
